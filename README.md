# Finnish Parliament Environmental Speech Analysis

## Project Description

A project to analyze how often Finnish politicians mention climate and environmental topics in plenary speeches from 2015 to 2025.

## Key Findings

- Mentions of climate and environmental keywords (like "ilmastonmuutos" and "luonnon monimuotoisuus") have decreased in recent years.
- The COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine coincided with a significant drop in climate-related discourse in parliament.

## Data Collection

- Speeches were scraped from the [Finnish Parliament website (https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/search/Sivut/Vaskiresults.aspx#).
- Selenium and BeautifulSoup were used to automate the data collection.
- See the [data collection notebook](https://github.com/silvsar/parliament_speeches/blob/main/Puheenvuorot_eduskunnassa.ipynb) for code and details.

## Data Analysis

- Data was cleaned, keywords identified, and frequencies analyzed by year, party, and politician.
- Visualizations were produced using Matplotlib.

## New Skills & Growth

- Learned advanced web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- Improved data wrangling and visualization skills in Python.
- Practiced extracting and parsing structured information from semi-structured web data.

## Future Work

- Would like to implement techniques to analyze sentiment and context, not just keyword frequency.
